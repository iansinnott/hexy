# hexy

A simple program like `hexdump`. This was written entirley as a learning project and is not suitable for real use.

## Usage

```
$ java -jar hexy-0.1.0-standalone.jar [filepath]
```

Output should be equivalent to `hexdump [filepath]`, and for the most part it is. However, on larger files there seems to be a bug. When running hexy on its own 4.4mb standalone jar there were slight differences between the output and that of `hexdump`.

## Options

No options are supported at this time.

## Examples

```
$ java -jar target/uberjar/hexy-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar ./hello.txt
